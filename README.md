# App

## Purpose

Shared Affair is an event planning and catering company that services approximately 200 events a year. These events require meticulous planning and as the business scales the current planning and scheduling process is becoming outdated, slow, and unreliable.

The purpose of this app is to streamline the event planning process for Shared Affair by replacing the current procedure and tools in place; they currently use google calendar, excel spreadsheets and direct communication. The app will allow admins to easily create and roster events as well as provide a streamlined method for employees to track upcoming events, allow employees to self register for work, provide relevant event information including other rostered employees, food lists and custom notes, and provide a way to easily track upcoming work schedules.

Although there are existing systems and software like Deputy, foundU and Kronos that handle employee scheduling, these systems are built around immutable variables that make it difficult for event planning and catering businesses to use. As it stands, most rostering tools allow an admin user to create a roster based on a consistent location (this may be the entire business or an area of the business like the “Kitchen” at a cafe).

While a business can set different locations, the information associated to the location does not allow for changes or updates and lacks the functionality to create a significant number of “locations”. In addition, these systems do not allow a location to be created with associated document uploads, notes, or specific information and because of this lacking functionality they do not meet the needs of Shared Affair who are looking for a solution that allows them to plan and schedule out hundreds of events and rosters and share the information with it’s employees.
